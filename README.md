Physical Security. Not software.

"Not a simulation. The other way around."


What is CU6E?
CU6E is a hardware security device and operating environment.
You place it on your desk. You plug it in.
Your computer becomes something else entirely.
Not a virtual machine. Not an emulator.
A real isolated environment — running on physics.

CU6E SECRET
The first device in the CU6E lineup.
Place it on the dock → it connects silently →
your system enters Inner Place —
a fully sandboxed environment built on top of your OS,
not inside it.
Your screen    → ours
Your input     → ours  
Your browser   → ours
Your files     → compressed, encrypted, protected

The host sees nothing unusual.
That's the point.

What it does
True Sandbox
A real isolated workspace. Not emulated.
What happens inside stays inside.
No traces. No logs. No leaks.
6× Compression + Encryption
Every file, every session, every byte —
compressed up to 6× and encrypted simultaneously.
Not one after the other. At the same time.
The result is smaller and stronger.
One Knob Interface
One physical control on the device.
Turn → navigate.
Click → confirm.
That's the entire interface.
Everything else is noise.
Cableless Media Stream
Built-in media pipeline.
Stream content to and from the device
without additional software or configuration.
Sandboxed Browser
Our own rendering engine.
Our own font table.
Our own input handling.
Runs over your monitor — not in it.
No Chromium. No Electron. No bloat.

Hardware
The device contains proprietary physical components
sealed at the factory.
Do not attempt to open the device.
The security mechanism is physical.
If the enclosure is breached —
the magic smoke escapes.
And magic smoke, once released,
does not go back in.
This is not a metaphor.
This is how it works.
Warranty:   void upon opening
Security:   void upon opening  
Everything: void upon opening

Philosophy
Security systems fail because they trust software.
Software can be copied. Patched. Reversed. Faked.
Physics cannot.
CU6E is built on a principle:
the secret lives in the hardware, not the algorithm.
The algorithm is open.
The hardware is sealed.
The smoke stays inside.
